# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

## A Little About Me  
- ⚽ Football fan and proud **bookworm**—novels are my jam! 📖  
- 🤖 Learning the ropes in **Data Science** and **AI** at **IIIT Dharwad**.  
- 🌍 Looking to collaborate with folks who know their way around this coding universe. 🚀  
- 📲 Find me on Instagram:** [@williskipsjr](https://www.instagram.com/williskipsjr). Let's chat!  
- 🙌 Fun fact: No matter who you are or where you're from—**Jesus loves you**!
